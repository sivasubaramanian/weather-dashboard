# Introduction
A weather dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with up-to-date information about the current weather conditions in a specific city. In this project, the user interacts with the dashboard by entering the name of the city they are interested in. The dashboard then utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to dynamically fetch and display the relevant weather details using the OpenWeatherMap API.

# Key Features:

# User Input:

The user is prompted to enter the name of the city they want to check the weather for.

# API Integration:

The OpenWeatherMap API is utilized to retrieve real-time weather data for the specified city. This includes details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions.

#Dynamic Display:

The retrieved weather information is dynamically displayed on the dashboard, providing users with a clear and organized overview of the current weather conditions.

# Visual Design:

HTML and CSS are employed to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. The design may include elements such as input fields, buttons, and responsive layouts to enhance the user experience.

# Asynchronous JavaScript:

Asynchronous JavaScript (e.g., using fetch or XMLHttpRequest) is employed to make API requests without causing the page to reload. This ensures a seamless and dynamic user interaction.

# Error Handling:

The application may include error handling mechanisms to address scenarios where the entered city name is invalid or the API request fails. This ensures a robust user experience even in less-than-ideal conditions.

# Responsive Design:

The dashboard may be designed to be responsive, adapting its layout to different screen sizes and devices, allowing users to access weather information on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure and markup for the dashboard.
CSS: Styles the HTML elements, enhancing the visual appeal of the dashboard.
JavaScript: Dynamically interacts with the HTML DOM and makes asynchronous requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
OpenWeatherMap API: External API used to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's input.
